- One reaction to rule them all.
  - Hope you have patience and also don't accidentally click twice.
- Run multiple commands?  That's not a problem since reacting to one paginator will update them all.
- Should I also mention that the paginator reaction doesn't even have to be added to a command response, hell, it doesn't even have to be added to a message by the bot.
