# Issues regarding competition commands.

## competition

- Dev is incompetent and requires you to type the time unit seperately to the time.
- Doesn't actually work because Try2Win4Glory is incapable of updating to the latest version of Nitro Type's API.

## leaderboard

- Requires going to some sketchy link that uses adl's/someone else's code.
