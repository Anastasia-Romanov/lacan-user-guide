## message

- Their pointless sfw filter is case-sensitive, "ass" is blacklisted but "Ass" isn't ðŸ™„.
- Their pointless sfw filter will also ban "innocent" words such as "assembly".
- Sending a message larger than the embed field limit will result in a 4xx error smh.
- Attempts to create an invite link without the users permission.
- Adl is still listed as a developer.

## ping

- Displays the websocket ping as the "users latency", which is completely inaccurate.

## uptime

- The bots creation date has nothing todo with the uptime.
