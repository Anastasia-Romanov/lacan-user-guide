## This document contains a list of issues with the current version that affect developer commands.


- Developer commands should not be deployed globally.  They should be only deployed to specific servers, as-needed.
- A number of commands in this category are not true "Developer" commands, as they're available to the support staff of various notable Nitro Type servers.  These should be reclassified.
